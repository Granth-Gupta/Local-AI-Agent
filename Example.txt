However, not all reviewers have been impressed with the vegan cheese. Document(id='119') gave a rating of 2 stars and stated that their vegan cheese option was "terrible", with a grainy texture and a strong coconut flavor that clashed with the tomato sauce.

Overall, it seems that the restaurant's vegan options are improving, but there is still room for improvement in terms of quality.
